His experience, consistency, and ability to chase down targets are unparalleled.\\n2.  **Rohit Sharma:** The captain across all formats, a prolific opener, especially in white-ball cricket, known for his elegant strokeplay and ability to score big hundreds.\\n3.  **Jasprit Bumrah:** Arguably the best all-format fast bowler in the world. His unique action, Yorkers, and ability to bowl at any stage of an innings make him a genuine match-winner.\\n4.  **Ravindra Jadeja:** A true all-rounder who excels in all three departments \\u2013 left-arm spin, powerful lower-order batting, and exceptional fielding. He provides crucial balance to the team.\\n5.  **Hardik Pandya:** An explosive all-rounder, vital for white-ball cricket with his powerful hitting and useful medium-pace bowling. He's a game-changer with his ability to finish innings and pick crucial wickets.\\n\\n**Other strong contenders who could easily be in a top 5 on another day:**\\n\\n*   **Shubman Gill:** A rising star, showing immense potential and consistent performances, especially in ODIs and Tests.\\n*   **Mohammed Shami:** A world-class fast bowler, especially potent in Tests and ODIs with his seam movement and wicket-taking abilities.\\n*   **Rishabh Pant:** While currently recovering from injury, his destructive batting and match-winning capabilities, particularly in Tests, are undeniable when fit.\"\n",
